The functions allow a visitor id to be created,which is achieved by a createId function
The save function writes the new visitor to a .JSON file.
The load function displays a visitors information when passed an id number.

To view the code:

The test file named visitorClassSpec is located in the spec folder
To run the tests, npm and jasmine must be installed 
And the command "jasmine" or "npm test"  can be used to execute the tests.
